This will let you set up the `houdini-pipeline` in Windows using a setup.exe file.
This also needs testing from another user if the submodule(folder) `houdini-pipeline` in this repo is actually the houdini-pipeline repository which is this: `https://github.com/manx151089/houdini-pipeline.git`
You might need to use the following command `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/manx151089/houdini-pipeline-setup`
